# Drone-Authentication-System
Secure drone operations system that controls access based on GPS coordinates and authorization to prevent unauthorized flights.

The Drone Authentication System project addresses the growing need for secure drone operations amid rising security concerns, such as the recent drone attacks at the Indian Air Force Station, Jammu. Instead of a blanket ban, this system offers a targeted solution by allowing only authorized drones to operate in specific areas. The system uses GPS and GSM modules, an Arduino Nano board, and a single-channel relay to monitor and control drone access. When a drone initiates a flight, the GPS module fetches its location and compares it with predefined restricted zones. If the drone attempts to enter a restricted area, access is denied, and the system cuts off power to the drone. For flights outside restricted zones, the droneâ€™s credentials and pilot information are sent to the Drone Authentication Center (DAC) for verification. If the DAC confirms the request, it grants permission to fly. This approach ensures enhanced security while enabling safe drone operations.
